Chip-E is a four servo bipedal robot kin to Zowi, BoB, Otto and others. 

Assembly instructions can be found on [learn.robotgeek.com](http://learn.robotgeek.com/projects/297-chip-e-assembly-guide.html).

To get started copy the Chip-E and Oscillator folders to your Arduino/libraries directory.

The Chip-E library and examples depend on other RobotGeek and 3rd party libraries available [here](https://github.com/robotgeek/robotGeekLibrariesAndtools).
